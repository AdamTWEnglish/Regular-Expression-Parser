# Regular-Expression-Parser
The program takes a regular expression. It then tests strings against the regular expression to determine whether they fit the logic of the regular expression

The project runs on java 11.0.20 and uses the testing packages junit-4.13.2.jar and hamcrest-core-1.3.jar

TODO:
- Fix * implementation
- Allow for nested bracket logic
- Add more regular expression characters
- Add more test cases
